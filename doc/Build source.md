# How to build source?
The service is implemented in golang. If golang compiler is available on server, then it can be compiled easily. If golang is missing on local server, then it can be
compiled in Docker container. In both the cases, we need Docker engine. Docker system can be installed depending on your Linux flavor. 

## Compiling by local golang compiler 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/msgparser/rawmessage.git
